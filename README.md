### Hi, I'm Christopher. ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kikos7/kikos7** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ¤” I am a full-stack developer looking for an opportunity in frontend work preferably, but i am open to backend.
- ðŸŒ± I primarily use React with TailwindCSS for the front-end, but i am also willing to learn new frameworks and web technologies.
- I have experienced with fetching data from an api and displayed the data with React in the following projects :
- [Notora](https://github.com/ChrisES7/Notora) for google maps streetview api, mapbox api and deezer api for music fetching.
- [Auracle](https://github.com/ChrisES7/Auracle) where I used many endpoints from spotify's api for data, authentication and music playing, as well as a quiz functionality.
- ðŸ”­ My most recent [project](https://github.com/ChrisES7/MusicalArt-Gallery) will be a music and painting inspired art gallery application using ExpressJS, a MySQL or MongoDB database, React and tailwind for css, created with Vite
- ðŸ’¬ I am open to any questions you may have about my experience or interests.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by email at : chriseskaf@gmail.com
