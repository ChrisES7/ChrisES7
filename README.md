### Hi, I'm Christopher. ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**kikos7/kikos7** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning React, but i am also willing to learn new frameworks and web technologies.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a Full-Stack internship, preferably, but i am open to front-end or backend.
- I have experienced with fetching data from an api and displayed the data with React
  
- I have made a task application that allows the user to login/register, to add,edit,view and delete a task. The app
  is connected to a MySQL database.
  
- ðŸ”­ My most recent [project](https://github.com/kikos7/taskManagementNodeApp) was a custom to do list application using ExpresJS, a MySQL database and Native Javascript. 
- ðŸ’¬ I am open to any questions you may have about my experience or interests.
